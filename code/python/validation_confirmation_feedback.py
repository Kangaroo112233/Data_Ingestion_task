Below are three new sub-sections you can drop into your trimmed-down Section 10.1 (immediately after the Performance Report and before Calibration), to address the MU and DI reviewer comments. Feel free to tweak figure/table numbering as needed.

10.1.7 Validation-Confirmation Use Case & Workflow
The Validation-Confirmation step is the final gating operation in our end-to-end pipeline. It runs after document classification and field extraction, and before ingesting results into downstream systems. If the VC model returns { "decision": "no" }, the document is routed to a manual indexing queue for human review; if { "decision": "yes" }, processing continues automatically.

Independent Step: VC does not feed back into upstream extraction; it simply confirms ownership.

Dependencies:

Classification must assign the correct document type (so we know which SoR fields to compare).

Extraction must produce the raw text (full document) and SoR metadata.

10.1.8 Sample-Size Justification
We used 172 held-out documents to estimate zero-shot VC performance. At an observed accuracy of 0.98, the 95 % confidence-interval half-width (margin of error) is:

Thus we can assert, with 95 % confidence, that true accuracy lies in [95 %, 100 %]. This margin is acceptable for production gating, and we will maintain it in ongoing monitoring by re-sampling at least 172 documents per quarter.

10.1.9 Stratified Performance Metrics
We report stratification both by decision class (belongs/doesn’t belong) and, going forward, by document type.

Decision Class	Precision	Recall	F1-Score	Support
belongs (yes)	0.95	1.00	0.98	81
doesn’t belong (no)	1.00	0.96	0.98	91

Belongs: the model correctly confirmed 100 % of true-yes cases (no false negatives).

Doesn’t belong: the model correctly rejected 96 % of true-no cases.

Next steps: in our ICM dashboard we will also break these metrics out by incoming document type (e.g. Income, Statement, W2, Death Cert, Signature Card), so we can detect drift per segment.

  Validation Confirmation Model

Purpose: As the final step in our ESO pipeline, the validation confirmation model ensures that the extracted reference-number (or “key”) from a given document truly matches the authoritative record in our System of Record (SOR).

Inputs:

Split classification output (document type)

Reference-number extraction (from data-extraction model)

Process:

Query the SOR using the extracted reference-number

Compare the SOR-returned canonical fields (e.g. name, address) against the OCR-extracted values

Compute a per-field confidence score and aggregate into an overall “validation” confidence

Outputs:

Validation = Yes (match above threshold)

Validation = No (mismatch or low confidence)

STP Yes/No Decision
Once validation completes, we branch on the boolean outcome:

Validation Result	Action
Yes	• → Straight-Through Processing (STP)
– Automatically route the document and its confirmed metadata into the downstream ingestion/indexing pipeline.
– Mark record as STP-eligible in the audit log.
No	• → Manual Review
– Flag the document for a human-in-the-loop exception workflow.
– Attach discrepancy details and confidence scores to the review ticket.

ME = z₀.₉₇₅ × √[p(1−p)/n]
   = 1.96 × √[(0.98 × 0.02)/172]
   ≈ 0.03 (±3 %)
