}

You are to extract these 24 fields from the document text. If a box is empty on the document, return 'NULL' for its value. Provide the output in JSON format i.e. name value pairs.
Your response should only contain the JSON output and nothing else. Each field name should appear only once in the JSON response and every value should be a string.
If multiple W2 forms exist, return the values of the first W2.
Stop responding after all 24 fields have been extracted."""
```

### **Maintained Structure:**
- ✅ Same NER model approach
- ✅ JSON output format requirement
- ✅ Field descriptions and context
- ✅ 'NULL' for empty boxes
- ✅ String values only
- ✅ First W2 if multiple forms
- ✅ Stop after all fields extracted

### **Enhanced Coverage:**
