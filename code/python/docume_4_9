For item 3 (Calibration and Use of Model Confidence Score):
Our model's confidence scoring mechanism is derived from the probability allocations during the token prediction process. When performing classification, this confidence metric corresponds to the probability value assigned to the selected label, generally the category receiving the highest probability coefficient following softmax transformation of the generated logits.
In extraction scenarios, confidence metrics are calculated from the sequence probabilities of tokens, reflecting the model's contextual understanding and structural recognition capabilities. These probability values directly affect how well the model interprets instructions and extracts pertinent information. We implement a logarithmic softmax function on the logits for extracted key elements and compute aggregate confidence values for each extraction key.
The calibration techniques we employ modify probabilities at the token level to enhance alignment with the model's internal processing, resulting in extracted information that more effectively represents the model's actual confidence assessment.
For item 5 (Data Quality Testing):
We've established robust verification protocols for incoming data that examine multiple aspects: quality assessment (identifying OCR degradation), distributional analysis (recognizing shifts in production-level patterns), format verification (detecting template modifications), and content validation (observing changes in document textual elements).
We will conduct systematic evaluations of all model-processed data and implement continuous monitoring systems to verify ongoing consistency with specified requirements. These proactive measures help us identify potential quality concerns before they negatively impact model effectiveness.
For item 10 (Data Extraction Integrity):
We will conduct expanded testing using a significantly more comprehensive sample set to verify consistent model extraction behavior. Statistical parameters will be established across adequate samples representing each variation type, allowing us to quantify confidence levels and error margins for information processed through the OCR system and subsequently handled by our GenAI implementation.
The test suite will encompass diverse name variations including alternative spellings, diacritical marks, compound structures with hyphens, possessive forms with apostrophes, upper/lowercase variations, name extensions, multi-part names, abbreviated forms, and statistically uncommon name patterns. Parallel testing methodologies will be applied to numeric field extraction to ensure thorough coverage.
For item 11 (Error Analysis):
Our classifier model demonstrates effective performance when identifying document categories with distinctive content signatures, where textual elements clearly differentiate document types (such as death certificates, signature cards, electronic communications, and legal agreements). The system encounters difficulties distinguishing between document categories with overlapping textual characteristics, notably confusing instructional correspondence with standard letters and administrative communications.
First-page identification accuracy diminishes considerably for subsequent pages due to textual similarity patterns. Certain document formats, including signature cards and instructional letters, feature heading elements on every page, resulting in misclassification of subsequent pages as document beginnings.


3. Calibration and Use of Model Confidence Score (Simplified)
The model gives a confidence score that shows how sure it is about the label or extracted data. For classification tasks, this score comes from the probability it assigns to each possible label, with the highest one usually chosen. This probability is calculated using a softmax function.

For extraction tasks, the model uses its understanding of the document structure and context to assign confidence scores to each piece of extracted text. We apply a method called logarithmic softmax to convert model predictions into confidence values for each key field.

We also use calibration techniques to adjust these confidence values so they more closely reflect the model’s actual reasoning during extraction, helping to ensure the results are accurate and reliable.

5. Data Quality Testing (Simplified)
We run regular checks on incoming data to ensure it meets expected quality standards. These checks look for things like poor OCR quality, unusual data patterns, changes in document format, and unexpected text changes.

We also perform routine audits on the data the model processes, making sure everything stays aligned with what the model expects. This helps us catch problems early and keep performance consistent over time.

10. Data Extraction Integrity (Simplified)
We plan to do more extensive testing with a larger and more varied set of documents. This will help us measure how confident the model is and how often errors occur when extracting data.

We’ll test names with different spellings, accents, hyphens, abbreviations, and rare formats. We’ll also test numeric fields to make sure the model extracts all variations correctly and consistently. This will give us a clearer picture of how reliable the model is in different situations.

11. Error Analysis (Simplified)
The model does a good job identifying document types that have unique, clearly defined content, like death certificates or trust agreements. But it sometimes struggles with documents that look similar—such as letters and instructions—because they share a lot of common text.

It also has trouble figuring out if a page is the first page of a document, especially when the layout looks the same across all pages.

In terms of extraction, the model works well when document quality is high, with clear images and easy-to-read text. But poor image quality or complex layouts can confuse it. This might lead to errors like blank outputs, incorrect field values, or picking up the wrong information.
