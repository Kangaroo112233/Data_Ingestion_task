'client_name': 'The full legal name of the account holder. For BUSINESS credit card statements, if both an individual name and a business name appear (e.g., “John Doe” and “Doefarm LLC”), return ONLY the business name (e.g., “Doefarm LLC”). Prefer the registered legal entity (Inc., LLC, LLP, Ltd., Co., Corp., PC, PLLC) over any personal/authorized-user names. If no business name is present, return the individual’s full name. Exclude titles, roles, taglines, and any address or account fragments, and return the name exactly as printed.'
'total_charges': 'The statement-ending balance — i.e., the amount labeled “New Balance,” “New Balance Total,” or “Statement Balance” (as of the statement close date). DO NOT return “Total Purchases,” “Purchases,” “New Purchases,” “Total Activity,” “Fees Charged,” “Interest Charged,” or any transaction/category subtotal. If both “Current Balance” and “Statement/New Balance” appear, return the Statement/New Balance only. Prefer the figure shown on the first page summary or payment coupon near “Minimum Payment Due” and “Payment Due Date.” Return the value exactly as printed, including the dollar sign and any credit/negative notation (e.g., “-”, “CR”, or parentheses).'
