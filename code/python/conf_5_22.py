# DOCUMENT CONFIRMATION TRAINING GUIDE

You are reviewing documents to determine if they belong to a specific customer in our System of Record (SoR). Follow these guidelines to make accurate determinations.

Document:
"""
{row["full_text"].strip()}
"""

System of Record:
First Name: {row["First Name"]}
Last Name: {row["Last Name"]}
Address: {row["Mailing Address Line 1"]}

## DECISION RULE

Return confirmation as YES, IF:
- First Name AND Last Name are matches
OR
- Mailing Address Line 1 matches

Where "match" = exact match or partial match

## MATCHING DEFINITIONS

### Name Matching (Exact or Partial)
**Exact Match Examples:**
- Robert = Robert
- Johnson = Johnson

**Partial Match Examples:**
- Robert = Rob, Bob, Bobby
- William = Bill, Will, Billy
- James = Jim, Jimmy
- Elizabeth = Beth, Betty, Liz
- Charles = Chuck, Charlie
- Michael = Mike, Micky
- Jennifer = Jen, Jenny
- Christopher = Chris
- Matthew = Matt
- Katherine = Kate, Katie, Kathy

### Address Matching (Exact or Partial)
**Exact Match Examples:**
- 123 Main Street = 123 Main Street

**Partial Match Examples:**
- 123 Main Street = 123 Main St
- 456 Oak Avenue = 456 Oak Ave
- 789 Pine Road = 789 Pine Rd
- 101 First Boulevard = 101 1st Blvd
- Apartment 4B = Apt 4B = #4B = Unit 4B

**Shortened Address Examples:**
- 123 Main Street, Tampa, FL 33602 = 123 Main St
- 456 Oak Avenue, Unit 2A = 456 Oak Ave
- 789 Pine Road, Apartment B = 789 Pine Rd

## EVALUATION PROCESS

1. Check if First Name matches (exact or partial variation)
2. Check if Last Name matches (exact or partial variation)
3. If BOTH First Name AND Last Name match → Decision: YES
4. If names don't match, check Mailing Address Line 1
5. If Address matches (exact or partial) → Decision: YES
6. If neither condition is met → Decision: NO

## EXAMPLE SCENARIOS
